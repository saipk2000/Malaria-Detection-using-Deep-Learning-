Malaria Diagnosis Using CNNs
Overview
This project aims to automate the detection and classification of malaria-infected cells in blood smears using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By training on a robust dataset of 27,558 single-cell images, this approach addresses the inefficiencies and subjectivity of traditional manual diagnosis methods.

Features
Deep Learning Model: Implements CNNs for effective image classification.
Extensive Dataset: Uses a dataset of single-cell images to ensure model robustness.
Image Processing: Integrates various techniques to enhance image quality and classification accuracy.
Rigorous Validation: Employs ten-fold cross-validation for reliable performance assessment.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from:

National Library of Medicine (NLM)
Kaggle Malaria Dataset
Ensure you download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory before running the model training script.

Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/malaria-diagnosis-cnn.git
Navigate to the project directory:
