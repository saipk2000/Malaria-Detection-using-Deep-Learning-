# Malaria-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-
Automated malaria diagnosis using a CNN model trained on 27,558 single-cell images. This project aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of detecting malaria-infected cells in blood smears, overcoming limitations of traditional manual methods. Includes a comparative analysis of image processing techniques to boost diagnostic reliability.
